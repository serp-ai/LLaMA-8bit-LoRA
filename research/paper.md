Abstract:
In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using the LLaMA (Large Language Model Adaptation) framework. We demonstrate how to create finetune datasets, merge adapter weights, quantize models, and train LLMs with LoRA (Low-Rank Adapters). We provide details on gathering samples of inputs and outputs, constructing prompt templates, and training models to complete prompts. We also discuss the use of weight merging for faster inference and quantization for memory-efficient deployment. Our experiments show that our approach is effective in generating high-quality datasets and training LLMs with improved performance.

Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks or domains can be challenging due to the need for high-quality datasets, efficient training techniques, and memory-efficient deployment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to fine-tuning LLMs using the LLaMA (Large Language Model Adaptation) framework. Our approach includes creating finetune datasets, merging adapter weights, quantizing models, and training LLMs with LoRA (Low-Rank Adapters).

Making Datasets
2.1 Gathering Samples
The simplest way to create a dataset is to gather a set of inputs and outputs using existing LLMs. We demonstrate how to take an existing dataset (e.g., Anthropic's HH) and use an LLM to alter the outputs and/or inputs to create a new dataset in the tone or personality of one's choosing. We also show how to generate datasets using few-shot templates with a desired task or API usage and have an LLM generate the outputs (and inputs, if desired).

2.2 Training a Model to Complete Prompts
We discuss training a model to complete prompts for tasks such as creative writing and idea generation. We describe how to add start and end tokens to each body of text, concatenate them, chunk them by the desired sequence length, and train a model.

Weight Merging
We present a technique to merge the LoRA adapter with the foundation model for further training, faster inference, and quantization. We provide a command to merge adapter weights and discuss the benefits of this approach.

Quantization
We discuss quantizing the model to 4/3/2 bit for memory-efficient deployment. We provide instructions and a link to the repository for quantization. We also emphasize the importance of merging the adapter before quantization.

Training
We provide details on training LLMs with LoRA using the Peft library. We discuss the recommended starting parameters, requirements, and training scripts. We also present optional techniques such as flash attention for faster training.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented a comprehensive approach to fine-tuning LLMs using the LLaMA framework. Our approach includes creating finetune datasets, merging adapter weights, quantizing models, and training LLMs with LoRA. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality datasets and training LLMs with improved performance. We believe that our approach will be valuable to researchers and practitioners working with large language models.
